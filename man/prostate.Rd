This data arises from a large study to examine EEG
correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism.

\details{
The prostate dataset consists of 52 prostate tumor and 50 normal samples.
Normal and tumor classes are coded in 0 and 1, respectively, in y vector.
Matrix x is gene expression data and arrays were normalized, log transformed,
and standardized to zero mean and unit variance across genes as described in
Dettling (2004) and Dettling and Beuhlmann (2002).
See Chung and Keles (2010) for more details.
