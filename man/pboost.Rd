\usage{
pboost(
  formula,
  data,
  fitFun,
  scoreFun,
  stopFun,
  ...,
  keep = NULL,
  maxK = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class ``\link{formula}'' in the form \code{y ~ x}, where the
RHS contains all of candidate features, and the feature vectors should be numeric.}

\item{data}{An data frame containing the variables in the model.}

\item{fitFun}{Function to fit the empirical risk function in
the form \code{fitFun(formula, data, ...)}.}

\item{scoreFun}{Function to compute the derivative of empirical
risk function in the form \code{scoreFun(object)}, where \code{object} is
returned by \code{fitFun}.
\code{scoreFun} should return a vector with the same length of \code{y} in \code{data}.}

\item{stopFun}{Stopping rule for profile boosting, which has the form
\code{stopFun(object)} to evaluate the performance of model \code{object} returned
by \code{fitFun}, such as \link{EBIC} or \link{BIC}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{fitFun}.}

\item{keep}{Initial set of features that are included in model fitting.
\strong{If \code{keep} is specified, it should also be fully included in the RHS of \code{formula}.}}

\item{maxK}{Maximal number of identified features.
If \code{maxK} is specified, it will supress \code{stopFun}, saying that the
profile boosting continues until the procedure identifies \code{maxK} features.
The pre-specified features in \code{keep} are counted toward \code{maxK}.}

\item{verbose}{Print the procedure path?}
}
\value{
Model object fitted on the selected features.
}
\description{
\code{pboost} is the generic workhorse function of profile boosting
framework for parametric regression.

n <- 200
p <- 300
x <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), n)
